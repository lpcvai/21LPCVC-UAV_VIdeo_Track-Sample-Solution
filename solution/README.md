# Drone-Vision-Spring-2021-Sample-Solution Development

## Installation
### Prerequisite
* __For desktop:__ Conda is required to handle the package installation. Follow this link to view the [Miniconda installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) page. 
* __For Raspberry Pi:__ Follow the instructions to [setup Fedora on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/lpcvai/20LPCVC-Video_Track-Sample_Solution/wiki/64-bit-Operating-System-On-Pi). Then, install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to handle the conda environment.

### Prepare
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lpcvai/21LPCVC-UAV_VIdeo_Track-Sample-Solution.git
    cd 21LPCVC-UAV_VIdeo_Track-Sample-Solution
    ```
    
2. Create a virtual environment and install it's dependencies:
    * __For desktop with Nvidia GPU__
      ```
      conda env create -f environment.yml     
      ```
    * __For desktop without Nvidia GPU__
      ```
      conda env create -f environment_nocuda.yml     
      ```
    * __For Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Fedora & Miniforge__
      ```
      conda env create -f environment_rpi.yml     
      ```
3. Activate conda environment
    ```
    conda activate SampleSolution
    ```



   
### Download Pre-trained Models
1. The trained weights are provided [here](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hu440_purdue_edu/EuCYkSRgyXVCh8PwwsHZ9lYBNfI4A4cLgdi5sHIlRSsZCQ?e=yjoJ2P).
The weights are called `best.pt` and should be placed under `yolov5/weights/`. 
We recommend using the `best.pt` weights, since it is using the smallest yolov5 model avalible, which is most sutibable for the Raspberry Pi / mobile. 
There is another model named yolov5l, which utilizes a more complex model for higher accuracy, but results in less FPS.
Make sure to use them to get the best detections.
The trained weights were created using a [dataset](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/akocher_purdue_edu/EeW4m2AjhuxFhIuwXFQNHcgB87WWzLYq6PVWMri9ZRjHIw?e=18ogEg) containing over 10,000 images. More stats on the dataset can be found in `yolov5/weights/stats.txt`.
Specific stats about the training session can be viewed [here](https://wandb.ai/dual19/...?workspace=user-dual19) if you're interested.
Quantization and pruning implementation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/PumeTu/21LPCVC-UAV_VIdeo_Track-Sample-Solution/tree/main/solution).

2. The DeepSORT weights need to be downloaded; they can be found [here](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/hu440_purdue_edu/EYvoc5gij4dNpcGJ5jnBW94BP5H5LU_dcW0dHtm_lX8aBQ?e=s8j3LW).
They should be called `ckpt.t7` and place it under `deep_sort/deep_sort/deep/checkpoint/`


## Input and Output Files
### Inputs
1. The first input will be a video. The sample videos can be located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S6kfqSG8AJpoj-y-4-nIagfmL7FpVTOf?usp=sharing).


2. The second input is a csv file, containing the first 10 frames for the solution to acquire the correct labels. An additional 10 frames will be provided in the middle of the video, to recalibrate the labels if some identity switching occurs. The format for the input file in `inputs/"videoname".csv` should be similar to the example below. NOTE: The delimiter between each value in the actual csv file will be a comma (","), the | is just for visualization. The bounding box coordinate system is based off of the YOLO annotation format. 

    | Frame | Class |   ID  |   X   |   Y   | Width | Height|
    |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
    |    0   |   0   |   1   |0.41015|0.39583|0.02031|0.03425|
    |    0   |   0   |   2   |0.36835|0.61990|0.04557|0.18055|
    |    0   |   1   |   3   |0.41015|0.39583|0.03593|0.16296|
    |    1   |   0   |   1   |0.52942|0.39583|0.02031|0.03425|
    |    1   |   0   |   2   |0.36835|0.61990|0.04557|0.18055|
    |    1   |   1   |   3   |0.52942|0.39537|0.03593|0.16296|


    - Frame: The frame number of the annotation
    - Class: 0 for person, 1 for sports ball

    - X      = absolute_x / image_width
    - Y      = absolute_y / image_height
    - Width  = absolute_width /image_width
    - Height = absolute_height /image_height




### Outputs
1. The only output from the solution should be a text file. This text file will include the location of every ball when a single ball has been caught. The format for the output file in `outputs/"videoname"_out.csv` should be similar to the example below. NOTE: The delimiter between each value in the actual csv file will be a comma (","), the | is just for visualization.


|  Frame | Yellow | Orange |  Red  | Purple |  Blue  | Green |   |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | ------ | ----- | - |
| 5 | 0  | 1 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 0 | - Person 4 catches blue |
| 30| 0  | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 0 | - Person 3 catches orange |
| 49 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 0 | - Person 1 catches red |
| 60 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 0 | - Person 5 catches blue |
